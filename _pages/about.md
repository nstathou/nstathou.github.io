## 💼 Short Bio

<div style="max-width: 760px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;"> My name is <strong>Nikolaos Stathoulopoulos</strong> <em>(Nikos for short)</em> and I am a <strong>Robotics &amp; AI Ph.D. candidate</strong> at <strong>Luleå University of Technology</strong> in Sweden. I am working at the intersection of <strong>localization, mapping</strong>, and <strong>3D perception</strong>. My research focuses on multi-robot/multi-session <strong>SLAM</strong> (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and <strong>long-term</strong> map management, often combining classical techniques with learning-based methods to make perception stacks more adaptive and reliable in the field. I care about systems that last, <strong>maps that age gracefully, scale efficiently, remain robust under change, and ultimately stand the test of time</strong>. Core topics include <strong>place recognition</strong>, <strong>loop closures</strong>, and <strong>back-end optimization</strong> for robust, lifelong operation. <br> <br> I hold a Bachelor's with an integrated Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <strong>University of Patras</strong> in Greece. During my current position as a Ph.D. student I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for <strong>Advanced Robotics</strong> and <strong>Computer Vision &amp; Image Processing</strong>. I’m active in the <strong>IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Society (RAS)</strong> and the broader robotics community, with publications in <strong>ICRA</strong>, <strong>IROS</strong>, <strong>RA-L</strong> and <strong>T-FR</strong>. I’m always open to collaboration, code sharing, and brainstorming, feel free to reach me. </div>
