<em> Sep 2025 - Dec 2025 </em>

<em> Teaching Assistant, RAI Group at Lulea University of Technology, Sweden </em>

During my Ph.D., I also contributed to the design of a module within the new Advanced Robotics course. Building on foundational robotics knowledge, this course introduces students to the key components of full-scale robot autonomy, including modeling, control, perception, planning, localization and mapping, and sensor fusion. The lectures and labs are designed to complement each other, providing both theoretical depth and practical, experimental insight.
Students work with a range of robotic platforms, such as: TurtleBot3, Crazyflie quadrotors, and Unitree quadrupeds, and conduct experiments using a motion-capture system in the Robotics Group’s flying arena at Luleå University of Technology. Laboratory assignments are implemented in MATLAB and Python, making extensive use of the Robotics Toolbox (a companion to Peter Corke’s textbook) and several open-source repositories from LTU and the wider robotics community.

My contribution to the course included designing and delivering three lectures on localization and mapping, as well as developing a hands-on laboratory exercise. To support the material, I published <strong>hello-slam</strong> on GitHub, a resource that introduces the theoretical foundations of SLAM accompanied by interactive Python notebooks. The associated lab guides students through implementing EKF-SLAM on a TurtleBot using its onboard 2D LiDAR and wheel odometry.

</summary>

<em> Sep 2024 - Dec 2024 / Sep 2025 - Dec 2025 </em>

<em> Teaching Assistant, RAI Group at Lulea University of Technology, Sweden </em>

During my Ph.D., I am serving (two semesters so far) as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Vision & Image Processing course, an introductory course covering both foundational and modern concepts in vision. Topics include camera models, multi-view geometry, 3D reconstruction, low-level image processing (e.g., segmentation), high-level vision tasks (e.g., object detection), and practical frameworks and libraries for building real-world applications. The course emphasizes both the mathematical foundations of the methods and their implementation through hands-on projects.
In addition to supervising and grading laboratory work, I co-designed the course projects and deliver two lectures on 3D perception.

<em> Sep 2023 - Dec 2023 </em>

<em> Teaching Assistant, RAI Group at Lulea University of Technology, Sweden </em>

During the first year of my Ph.D., I also served as a Teaching Assistant for the Robotics course, which introduces fundamental concepts in modern robotics. The course covers topics such as representing position and orientation, robot motion, navigation, localization, forward and inverse kinematics for robotic manipulators, image processing, feature extraction, and vision-based control.
My responsibilities included supporting students during laboratory sessions and evaluating laboratory assignments.

<summary markdown="span"> 🔴 <strong> Industrial Automation R7008E </strong>
</summary>

<em> Mar 2023 - Jun 2023 </em>

<em> Teaching Assistant, RAI Group at Lulea University of Technology, Sweden </em>

During the first year of my Ph.D., I served as a Teaching Assistant for the Industrial Automation course, having previously completed the course during my Erasmus exchange studies. The course introduces key concepts in industrial automation, including basic automation elements, hardware components for automation and process control, the latch principle, automation system synthesis, logical design, electro-pneumatic systems, industrial networks, PLC programming, and PID control in industrial settings.
My responsibilities included leading laboratory sessions, providing one-on-one and group support to students, designing project assignments, and grading coursework. Throughout the course, we worked with tools such as Automation Studio, STEP 7, and Siemens PLCs.

<em> Mar 2022 - Jun 2022 </em>

<em> Teaching Assistant, ML Group at Lulea University of Technology, Sweden </em>

During my Master’s thesis Erasmus exchange at Luleå University of Technology, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the Advanced Deep Learning course. This master's-level course covers state-of-the-art deep learning methods, including the vanishing gradient problem and modern architectural solutions such as ResNets and LSTMs, reinforcement learning and artificial curiosity, image captioning and visual question answering, deep learning for NLP, and other cutting-edge model designs.
In my role as Teaching Assistant, I supported lectures by engaging with students during discussions, supervised laboratory sessions, and contributed to the evaluation of student work.
